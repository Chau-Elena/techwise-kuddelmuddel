## ðŸŒ¿ ðŸŒ± Welcome to Kuddelmuddel! ðŸŒ± ðŸŒ¿
> As a simple garden weed, you're fed up with the mistreatment: either you're stepped on, dug up, or sprayed with nasty chemicals! Now, you must rise up against the weed whackers and dominate the entire world in weeds!

> Start small, harvest seeds, and exchange them for various power-ups to grow larger and larger. Random events and natural disasters will try to hinder you, but with the right Mindset, nothing can stop your weed army! How big can you grow?
